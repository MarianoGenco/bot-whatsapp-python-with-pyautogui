In the spreadsheet you can enter the names of the contacts, and their telephone numbers. There is an example of how you can put the contacts. Within the code is commented what each part of it does.
You can improve it to your liking. You can also send images that are in a folder within the project. If you need me to improve the code to be able to send images, do not hesitate to ask.

Remember that the WhatsApp API requires the country code, for example, for Argentina it is 54.
You can change the message, if you need it to be in separate messages you can put <code>\n</code> in the message line.
